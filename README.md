# CCLF File Layouts

This set of scripts generates fake files and data to adhere to the
specifications outlined in the CMS Accountable Care Organization â€“ Operational
System (ACO-OS) Claim and Claim Line Feed (CCLF) Information Packet (IP) Version
38.0, dated 02/02/2024

The PDF for this specification can be
[downloaded here](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cclf-information-packet.pdf).

Each of the file types is generated using a Python script that generates random
data based on the specifications provided in the PDF.

Open `main.py` and change the `number_of` properties as desired, then execute
`main.py` to generate the files. For example:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will generate fake CCLF files for each of the file types listed in the PDF.

The generated files will be written to the `_output` directory and have a
filename that includes the date, time, and type of file. The filenames follow
the formats specified in the requirements.

Each file contains random data based on the specifications provided in the PDF.

The scripts use [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to produce
pseudo-random data for fields such as dates and names. The Faker library is used
to generate realistic looking data, but it does not guarantee that the data will
be realistic or accurate in any way.
